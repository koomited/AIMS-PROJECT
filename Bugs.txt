1- Error of Cuda Memory
Solution: run
import os
os.environ["PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF"] = "max_split_size_mb:1024"

AND WITHOUT RESTARTIN THE KERNEL run the following code. Run it before importing torch

2- Patch max_split_size_mb

The heigh(h) and the width(w) has to be  multiple of 2 and a mutiple of the patch size at the same time.

we therefore add some padding p2d = (1,2, 1, 2), that we have to remove from the prediction array by sliccing

examples: pred.surf_vars["2t"][0, 0].numpy()[6:-6,6:-6]
